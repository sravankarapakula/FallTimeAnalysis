# FallTimeAnalysis
Our Python project "Fall Time Detection" analyzes video to track a object fall time and bounce count using OpenCV. By isolating the object's color in HSV space, we detect its motion, calculate fall times, and visualize results with Matplotlib. This project applied computer vision and time-based event detection techniques.
