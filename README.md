# FallTimeAnalysis
Ball Motion Analysis in Videos This Python script analyzes the motion of a ball in a video, detecting its bounces and measuring the fall time for each bounce. It utilizes computer vision techniques to process the video frames and extract relevant information about the ball's motion. Features • Detects a ball's motion in a video based on its color (e.g., red, yellow). • Counts the number of bounces made by the ball. • Calculates the fall time for each bounce. • Visualizes the fall time evolution for each bounce using Matplotlib. Dependencies • Python 3.x • OpenCV (cv2) • Matplotlib (matplotlib) • NumPy (numpy)
